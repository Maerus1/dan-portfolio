This is a basic website-style portfolio to showcase the work that I have done thus far.
The intention is for me to continuously add and improve this site so that employers and 
friends will be able to enjoy my creations,so come back often!

This portfolio uses bootstrap for its mobile-first formatting and jQuery (using ajax and JSONP) 
to add functionality and retrieve information from various API's.

Enjoy!
~ This is an old project which has not been kept up for personal reasons.
